## Design Process Framework

### 1. User Journey Mapping

**Journey Map Template**
```
PERSONA: [Primary User]
SCENARIO: [Main use case]

PHASES:      AWARENESS → ONBOARDING → FIRST USE → REGULAR USE → ADVOCACY
              
ACTIONS:     Discovers   Signs up      Explores    Uses daily    Recommends
             product     Connects      features    Customizes    Shares wins
                        data                       workflow      

THOUGHTS:    "Can this   "Is this     "How do I   "This saves  "My team
             help me?"   secure?"     do X?"      me hours!"   needs this!"

EMOTIONS:    😐 Curious  😟 Cautious  😊 Excited  😍 Delighted 🤝 Loyal
             
PAIN POINTS: Finding     Privacy      Learning    Feature      Sharing
             solution    concerns      curve      discovery     limits
